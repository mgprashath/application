Here are presentation notes for your “Requirement” slide:

Slide Notes:
	•	This slide explains why we are taking immediate action.
	•	A recent penetration test exposed several critical security vulnerabilities in our legacy Classic ASP system.
	•	These include: missing HTTP security headers, inline script usage, and sensitive data passed in GET requests, all of which increase risk.
	•	While migrating to a modern framework like ASP.NET Core or other technologies would be ideal, it’s not currently practical due to budget, time, or integration dependencies.
	•	So the short-term requirement is clear:
	•	We need to fix the vulnerabilities in the existing Classic ASP application to reduce risk and stay compliant.
	•	At the same time, we’ll plan for a future system upgrade when feasible.
